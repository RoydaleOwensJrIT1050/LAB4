        <p>The city of Omen was discovered in 2030 by billionaire Bill Evans, Bill purchased a large piece of land six hours away Cleveland Ohio. Bill wanted to create a city that was like no other, with the help of Evans tech that was possible. Evans created a force shield around the city of Omen that allows him to change the weather of the city and the ability to create any environment he chooses. The city of Omen was able to be finished by the year of 2040. Bill envisioned the city of Omen as the city of fortune, Bill went all over to find all type of rare items for the city.  Bill wanted visitors and citizens to also have a chance to find fortune, so anyone that brings something that is worthy in the city theyâ€™ll receive a million dollars. Also, any who find something in the city can take it home with them home. Omen is built on the top of mines with gems worth thousands the deeper you go in the mines.</p>

        <p>On June 13th, 2035, a sad incident occurred while the Omen museum was being built. When the museum was being built a fire broke out. No one knows exactly what caused the fire to start, some people believes that a creature may have started the fire but that remains just an urban legend. The men and women are remembered with their names on the wall as you enter the museum.
